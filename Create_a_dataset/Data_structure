The data type structures of R include scalar, vector, matrix, array, data frame and list.

# vector
one-dimentional array for storing numeric, character or logical data ~ c()
* data in a single vector must have the same type or schema

# matrix
a two-dimentional array (numeric, character, logical data)
general format:
mymatrix <- matrix (vector, nrow=number_of_rows, ncol=number_of_colums, byrow=logical_value, dimname=list(char_vector_rownames, char_vector_colnames))
X[i,] is ith row
X[,j] is the jth column
